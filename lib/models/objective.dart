/// The purpose of this class is to provide a common way to access to the objective that the application should display.
/// The rules are:
/// 1. If an objective is already recorded into the database for the selected day, it should be the one displayed.
/// 2. If no objective is in the database for the current day, we give the objective stored into the shared preferences.
/// 3. The [streamCtlr] always gives the "good" objective to use. So only one subscription is required.
/// 4. In case of modification by the user,
///    if an objective entry exists for the current day into the database, it should be modified.
///    The shared preferences entry is also updated.
/// 5. If the current date has no objective entry, only the user prefs is updated.
